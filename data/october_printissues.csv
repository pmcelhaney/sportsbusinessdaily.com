The Raiders once again are dominating headlines for the wrong reasons, as Al Davis&rsquo; 45-minute press conference announcing the dismissal of Lane Kiffin turned the ongoing front-office saga into what&nbsp;SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS columnist Ann Killion calls a &ldquo;freak show.&rdquo; Davis&rsquo; decision not to pay Kiffin for the remainder of his contract undoubtedly will lead to another protracted lawsuit for one of the league&rsquo;s most litigious owners, drawing even more attention to the team&rsquo;s struggles on and off the field. Davis was his old fiery self Tuesday during his first appearance in front of the media in some time, stating Kiffin had disgraced the organization. But many are pointing the finger at Davis, who is now on his fifth coach since Jon Gruden left for Tampa, for letting the situation &quot;drag out and become a spectacle.&quot; And the mess has some wondering if the Raiders can be successful with Davis running a franchise that quickly has become the &ldquo;laughingstock of the NFL.&rdquo; See (#13) for more.</p>","<p><strong>Publishing Notice</strong> <br />

Wall Street is taking a dive again today, as the Dow is below 10,000 for the first time in four years, and&nbsp;more news outlets are looking at the potential impact on sports. While most experts say the sports business is&nbsp;insulated for now because of long-term contracts, most warn of a ripple effect the longer this goes on. That of course could impact sponsorship spending and activation, as well as franchise values and stadium financing. Of all the properties, much of the focus is on the PGA Tour, which has a slew of corporate support from an imperiled finance industry. PGA Tour Exec VP &amp; CMO Tom Wade sounds a familiar refrain when he says, &ldquo;For the short term, we're actually in pretty good shape. In the longer term, if this persists, we just don't know.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Bruins Owner Jeremy Jacobs says&nbsp;that New York &quot;would be hit hardest by a decline in corporate sponsorship.&quot; (#17)</p>","<p><strong>Driving The Lane</strong><br />

The term &ldquo;sophomore slump&rdquo; is&nbsp;likely to be a main topic of conversation around the league&rsquo;s N.Y. offices today, as ratings for TBS&rsquo; second season of postseason baseball coverage are down more than 20% from last year. Most observers felt Turner could overcome the lack of either N.Y. team advancing to October with both clubs from the second- and third-largest markets, in addition to baseball-mad Boston and Philly, making the playoffs. However, the allure of last week&rsquo;s VP debate and the lack of any series going&nbsp;five games continue to keep fans away from the telecasts. The net now must hope enthusiasm for the Red Sox&rsquo; quest for back-to-back World Series titles and the Rays&rsquo;&nbsp;most unlikely&nbsp;run continues to the ALCS. The good news: last year&rsquo;s Rockies-D&rsquo;Backs&rsquo; NLCS&nbsp;set the bar fairly low.

The global financial crisis has touched another segment of the sports industry, as FA Chair Lord David Triesman threatens several measures to &quot;rein in the perceived excesses&quot; of the Premier League, most notably a salary cap to curtail the extravagant spending of debt-riddled clubs. In an effort to subvert &quot;very tangible dangers&quot; for the league's future, Triesman states his desire to re-establish the FA as regulator of the EPL. He also echoes FIFA President Sepp Blatter's criticism of the insufficiently stringent test to which prospective owners are subjected. But the EPL for now does not share Triesman's concerns, as CEO Richard Scudamore asserts debt &quot;to a degree is healthy.&quot; (#11) Meanwhile, EPL club West Ham United may be &quot;on the brink of a financial crisis,&quot; after the nationalization of Iceland-based bank Landsbanki leaves the club's owner with an &quot;almost worthless&quot; major shareholding.

Buoyed by young stars like&nbsp;Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin (#4) the league hopes&nbsp;to capitalize on the momentum from last season&rsquo;s Stanley Cup Finals. However, amid the struggling economy the league may be challenged to match last year's success.

<p>With the global markets continuing to be in a free fall, more victims of the financial crisis are beginning to emerge in the sports industry. Tribune Co.'s methodical sale of the Cubs takes another hit, as Mark Cuban, one of the leading bidders, reveals that the failing economy has &quot;put the brakes on the sale.&quot; Also, the investment firm charged with brokering a sale of Mike Ashley's Newcastle United says finding a buyer &quot;could prove impossible&quot; in the current climate. But other sports entities have had better luck in the floundering market. The Mets seem to have subverted the crisis, selling out luxury suites at Citi Field and posting &quot;extremely high&quot; renewal rates for season-ticket holders. Also, while Vancouver and London Olympics officials previously have noted strains due to the economy, construction for the 2014 Sochi Games remains on schedule, though officials admit that the credit crunch &quot;may be felt&quot; in coming months (#19). Meanwhile, F1 teams are mostly receptive (#13) to a cost-cutting plan purportedly necessary for the circuit's survival, and European soccer officials downplay concerns over EPL debt levels (#12).</p>","<p><strong>For Sale Sign?&nbsp;</strong>(#14)<br />

While most major sports leagues in recent years have begun implementing plans to expand globally, the NBA remains at the forefront of international expansion efforts. As the league continues its NBA Europe Live exhibition tour, most recently featuring Nets-Heat before a sellout crowd at London's O2 arena, David Stern expresses a desire to see regular-season games in the U.K. by 2012. Stern also identifies the country as one that &quot;could eventually host a franchise,&quot; although doubts remain as to whether there is enough fan interest to sustain a team over an entire season (#11). Meanwhile, the growth efforts extend beyond just Europe, as the NBA and AEG finally unveil details of their long-discussed, multi-billion dollar joint venture to develop and operate arenas in China (#21). Stateside, the Nuggets and Suns play an outdoor exhibition under the lights at Indian Wells. While some players bemoan&nbsp;chilly temperatures, the sellout crowd generates an &quot;undeniable buzz&quot; for what could become an annual event (#22).</p>","<p><strong>Numbers Game </strong>(#4)<br />

With the country&nbsp;paying close attention to both the instability of the economy (#19) and the nearing Presidential election, it would not surprise many if ratings for sporting events this month were lower than normal. However, just the opposite appears to be the case. TBS&rsquo; coverage of the Rays-Red Sox ALCS is earning nearly 40% higher marks than last year&rsquo;s NLCS, as the net is clearly reaping the benefits of the huge&nbsp;interest in the defending World Series champs.&nbsp;Turner really would see some large numbers if the Sox can slow down the Tampa bats and keep this series competitive (#4). And while ratings are down through the first four games of the NLCS on Fox, all the net has to do is look at its other main property to see the reverse effect. Sunday&rsquo;s epic Cowboys-Cardinals OT thriller gains Fox' highest&nbsp;rating of any NFL broadcast this year (#5). On the college side, ABC&rsquo;s Saturday afternoon regional football games nearly double the ratings from the comparable year-ago matchups.</p>","<p><strong>Sunday Silence</strong><br />

In Myles Brand's continuing quest to emphasize the student in student-athlete, the NCAA this week gets good news as the latest Graduation Success Rate report reveals a graduation rate of 79% for student-athletes who enrolled in '01, the highest rate since the NCAA began keeping GSR stats. Women's sports continue to lead the way, boasting rates consistently above 80%, while 27 Division I men's basketball programs also stand out with 100% graduation rates. But elsewhere on the hardwood, there are signs that the sport &quot;remains a problem area,&quot; as 30 of 73 men's basketball programs in the top six conferences failed to graduate more than half of their players.

Some of the most powerful, wealthy players in the sports industry continue to be interested in MLS, as evidenced by the names that formally bid for one of the league&rsquo;s two expansion teams yesterday. Arthur Blank, Eugene Melnyk, George Gillett and FC Barcelona are among the seven entities that are trying to secure a club that would begin play in 2011 (#11). None of the bids currently have all of the components MLS is looking for -- the lack of a viable facility a glaring absence in several proposals -- but all have unique qualities that should make for a close race over the next several months (#12). The most notable group not to bid: the Mets, who pulled their bid due to a lack of a &ldquo;world class facility.&rdquo; There is some news coming from teams that are already on the pitch &ndash; the Revolution are again making noise about building a soccer-specific stadium closer to Boston than their current home in Foxborough.

The significance behind the deal is that Legends will manage regular concessions, suite catering and team stores at the new Yankees and Cowboys stadiums, which are set to open next year at a cost of more than $1B each.

Claims that&nbsp;a Phillies-Rays World Series would be Fox&rsquo; worst nightmare from a ratings perspective may&nbsp;have been a bit premature. The Rays&rsquo; ALCS Game Seven win over the Red Sox Sunday night draws 13.4 million viewers, the largest audience ever for a baseball game on cable and the second-largest audience for a cable program this year (#6). Even better news for MLB -- the game soundly defeats NBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;SNF&rdquo;&nbsp;Seahawks-Buccaneers&nbsp;telecast both nationally and in the Tampa-St. Pete market. Fox&rsquo; Ed Goren continues to preach that a long, competitive series can trump the lack of glamour teams, and the net has to hope recent history of quick Fall Classics is thwarted. For TBS, the ratings validate the improvements the net made production-wise in its second year of postseason baseball.

The&nbsp;World Series gets underway tonight from Tampa, and the surprising Phillies-Rays matchup offers a bevy of business angles. While some believe Fox execs should be sweating over the possibility of record-low ratings, the net maintains its stance that the quality and length of the series, not the teams, will impact viewership. But is the Fall Classic still a must-see TV event? ESPN&rsquo;s Jayson Stark asks, &ldquo;Whatever happened to the World Series?&rdquo; while the L.A. TIMES&rsquo; Bill Plaschke writes the Fall Classic is &ldquo;no longer an event of great general interest.&rdquo; (#6) The Rays hope to parlay their remarkable run into success on the business side, but Owner Stu Sternberg admits the sagging economy &quot;could kill us.&quot; (#17) That same concern does not appear headed to the TV side, as Fox is almost sold out of ad inventory for the first five games (#22). Meanwhile, with the two clubs featuring several prominent African-American stars, this could be the boon MLB is looking for to revitalize the game in the inner city (#15).</p>","<p><strong>Catch A Rising Star</strong><br />

It's only one game, but&nbsp;critics' suspicions&nbsp;about the lack of interest in this year's World Series may have some validity. The&nbsp;Phillies' 3-2 win over the Rays in a close ballgame&nbsp;earns only a 9.2/15 final&nbsp;rating, a 12.4% decrease from last year. However, there may be a silver lining for Fox -- the figures are&nbsp;up from those seen during the all-time low '06 Cardinals-Tigers series (#7). Meanwhile, Fox is doing its part to keep advertisers happy, rewarding big sponsors with in-game product mentions in addition to their regular spots, the most notable being Taco Bell's free taco promo (#1). While the Rays stumbled out of the box last night, team President Matt Silverman indicates the club&rsquo;s success is a sign of things to come, noting the Rays are likely to turn a profit this year on the strength of the playoff run and an expanding fan base (#17). And Bud Selig attributes the Rays' renewal to MLB's competitive balance, which he says produces &quot;hope and faith&quot; for all teams (#11).</p>","<p><strong>Bent Out Of Shape?</strong><br />

Two big events are taking place this weekend that continue to show the globe is becoming smaller when discussing world-class sports. The Chargers and Saints square off Sunday in the NFL&rsquo;s second venture to the U.K. for a regular-season game, something NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell calls a &ldquo;very important step&rdquo; in the league&rsquo;s development as a brand in Europe. He also mentions that there may be more than one game held across the pond in years to come. But while the game is a sell out, there is a considerable lack of buzz on the streets of London compared to last season&rsquo;s debut. Coverage in the London dailies has been scarce, and one columnist notes the NFL &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t on everybody&rsquo;s mind, not even this week&rdquo; (#12). There is, however, excitement in Santa Anita, where the Breeders' Cup kicks off amid the &quot;biggest shake-up in the 25-year history&quot; of the event. The two days of racing will be held on a new synthetic surface and will feature a large number of European entrants (#26).</p>","<p><strong>October Road</strong>&nbsp;(#4)<br />

We're growing (overseas) and the facts support it.&quot; Where to next?

After last night's three-game appetizer, the NBA tips off the '08-09 season in full force tonight with a loaded slate of games.

The Jazz are experiencing a changing of the guard, as Greg Miller begins his first season leading the franchise in place of his father (#17). Meanwhile, Nets Owner Bruce Ratner reportedly has entertained offers from two foreign ownership groups, which &quot;speaks to the trouble&quot; he has had with the Barclays Center and the &quot;financial beating he has taken&quot; with the team (#16).

One of the most bizarre World Series ever contested comes to an end with the Phillies winning the club&rsquo;s first title in 28 years. The conclusion of Game Five sees Fox earn a 13.4/21 overnight rating for the roughly 80 minutes of play last night (#7), and the speed baseball is getting some high praise today. The L.A. TIMES&rsquo; Bill Shaikin writes the series &ldquo;ought to be remembered for its rollicking finish,&rdquo; while the BOSTON GLOBE&rsquo;s Nick Cafardo writes the game &quot;went far in erasing the worst of Weathergate.&quot; Meanwhile, the notion of holding a World Series at a neutral, warm-weather locale is picking up steam from some unlikely sources&nbsp;-- Baseball HOFer Peter Gammons writes the idea of a &ldquo;World Series week has some advantages.&rdquo; Bud Selig is still defending his decision to suspend the eventual series-clinching game, even jokingly inferring the Phils would have hosted games when the weather was nice had Brad Lidge not lost the All-Star Game (#14). But to the Philly faithful, the extra obstacles are of no matter -- fans waste no time buying championship merchandise (#2).</p>","<p><strong>Return To Sender</strong><br />
