<p>Raiders Owner&nbsp;Al Davis&rsquo; 45-minute press conference Tuesday <a articleid=""124402"" href=""/article/124402"">announcing the&nbsp;dismissal of Lane Kiffin</a> turns the ongoing front-office saga into what&nbsp;SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS columnist Ann Killion calls a &ldquo;freak show.&rdquo; Davis&rsquo; decision not to pay Kiffin for the remainder of his contract undoubtedly will lead to another protracted lawsuit for one of the league&rsquo;s most litigious owners, drawing even more attention to the team&rsquo;s struggles. Davis was his old fiery self&nbsp;during his first appearance in front of the media in some time, stating Kiffin had disgraced the organization. But many are pointing the finger at Davis for letting the situation &quot;drag out and become a spectacle.&quot; And the mess has some wondering if the Raiders can be successful with Davis running a franchise that quickly has become the &ldquo;laughingstock of the NFL.&rdquo;</p>","<p><strong>Publishing Notice</strong>&nbsp;<br />

Wall Street is taking a dive again today, as the Dow is below 10,000 for the first time in four years, and&nbsp;more news outlets are looking at the <a href=""/article/124438"">potential impact on sports.</a> While most experts say the sports business is&nbsp;insulated for now because of long-term contracts, most warn of a ripple effect the longer this goes on. That of course could impact sponsorship spending and activation, as well as franchise values and stadium financing. Of all the properties, much of the focus is on the PGA Tour, which has a slew of corporate support from an imperiled finance industry. PGA Tour Exec VP &amp; CMO Tom Wade sounds a familiar refrain when he says, &ldquo;For the short term, we're actually in pretty good shape. In the longer term, if this persists, we just don't know.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Bruins Owner Jeremy Jacobs says&nbsp;that New York &quot;would be hit hardest by a decline in corporate sponsorship.&quot;</p>","<p><strong><a href=""/article/124464"">Driving The Lane</a><br />

<p>The term &ldquo;sophomore slump&rdquo; is&nbsp;likely to be a main topic of conversation around the league&rsquo;s N.Y. offices today, as ratings for TBS&rsquo; second season of postseason baseball coverage are <a href=""/article/124498"">down more than 20% from last year</a>. Most observers felt Turner could overcome the lack of either N.Y. team advancing to October with both clubs from the second- and third-largest markets, in addition to baseball-mad Boston and Philly, making the playoffs. However, the allure of last week&rsquo;s VP debate and the lack of any series going&nbsp;five games continue to keep fans away from the telecasts. The net now must hope enthusiasm for the Red Sox&rsquo; quest for back-to-back World Series titles and the Rays&rsquo;&nbsp;most unlikely&nbsp;run continues to the ALCS. The good news: last year&rsquo;s Rockies-D&rsquo;Backs&rsquo; NLCS&nbsp;set the bar fairly low.

<p>The global financial crisis has touched another segment of the sports industry, as FA Chair Lord David <a href=""/article/124518"">Triesman threatens several measures</a> to &quot;rein in the perceived excesses&quot; of the Premier League, most notably a salary cap to curtail the extravagant spending of debt-riddled clubs. In an effort to subvert &quot;very tangible dangers&quot; for the league's future, Triesman states his desire to re-establish the FA as regulator of the EPL. He also echoes FIFA President Sepp Blatter's criticism of the insufficiently stringent test to which prospective owners are subjected. But the EPL for now does not share Triesman's concerns, as CEO Richard Scudamore asserts debt &quot;to a degree is healthy.&quot; Meanwhile, EPL club West Ham United may be &quot;<a href=""/article/124526"">on the brink of a financial crisis</a>,&quot; after the nationalization of Iceland-based bank Landsbanki leaves the club's owner with an &quot;almost worthless&quot; major shareholding.</p>","<p><strong><a href=""/article/124545"">Dollars &amp; Sense</a> </strong><br />

<p>In Myles Brand's continuing quest to emphasize the student in student-athlete, the NCAA this week gets good news as the latest Graduation Success Rate report reveals a <a href=""/article/124700"">graduation rate of 79% for student-athletes </a>who enrolled in '01, the highest rate since the NCAA began keeping GSR stats. Women's sports continue to lead the way, boasting rates consistently above 80%, while 27 Division I men's basketball programs also stand out with 100% graduation rates. But elsewhere on the hardwood, there are signs that the sport &quot;remains a problem area,&quot; as 30 of 73 men's basketball programs in the top six conferences failed to graduate more than half of their players.

<p>It's only one game, but&nbsp;critics' suspicions&nbsp;about the lack of interest in this year's World Series may have some validity.

However, there may be a <a href=""/article/124943"">silver lining for Fox</a> -- the figures are&nbsp;up from those seen during the all-time low '06 Cardinals-Tigers series.

The Chargers and Saints square off Sunday in the <a href=""/article/124982"">NFL&rsquo;s second venture to the U.K.</a> for a regular-season game, something NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell calls a &ldquo;very important step&rdquo; in the league&rsquo;s development as a brand in Europe. He also mentions that there may be more than one game held across the pond in years to come. But while the game is a sell out, there is a considerable lack of buzz on the streets of London compared to last season&rsquo;s debut. One columnist notes the NFL &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t on everybody&rsquo;s mind, not even this week.&rdquo; There is, however, <a href=""/article/124962"">excitement in Santa Anita</a>, where the Breeders' Cup kicks off amid the &quot;biggest shake-up in the 25-year history&quot; of the event.

<p>One of the most bizarre World Series ever contested comes to an end with the Phillies winning the club&rsquo;s first title in 28 years. The conclusion of Game Five sees Fox earn a <a href=""/article/125132"">13.4/21 overnight rating</a> -- the highest overnight of the series -- for the roughly 80 minutes of play last night, and the speed baseball is getting some high praise today.
